# desc: Every cookbook page declares one rung of the verification ladder, by name.
#
# For a long time 23 of the 30 pages said "**Status: verified**", which meant six
# different things: schema-validated, built on one target, built on four, booted once
# by hand, booted with markers, or actually watched working. A reader could not tell
# which, and neither could we.
#
# The ladder is defined in CONTRIBUTING.md. Claiming a rung you did not reach is the
# one thing this project treats as a real error, so the vocabulary is worth enforcing
# even though the honesty behind it cannot be.
#
# Whole-tree by design: the value of a shared vocabulary is that it holds everywhere,
# and a new page is exactly the one most likely to invent its own word.
