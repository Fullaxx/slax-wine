# Adapted from slax-kitchen @ 3a44e8a852f750fc4cb7f7743c6544b63eb2b54e (ci/checks/80-unit.sh). ONE difference,
# the `# desc:` line; re-adapt on a submodule bump, see docs/UPSTREAM.md.
#
#   Upstream's reads "the recipe engine's pure logic", which this repo does not have: it owns
#   no engine code (docs/ARCHITECTURE.md). tests/unit/ here holds the recipe-content check
#   and three tests of the gates themselves, and the desc line is printed on every gate run,
#   so it should say what it actually checks.
#
#   There used to be a second difference: our workaround for slax-kitchen #23, which cleared
#   git's repository-local variables around each test. Upstream fixed #23 the same way in
#   3a44e8a, so ours is retired -- docs/UPSTREAM.md, "Local workarounds".
# stages: pre-commit pre-push ci
# desc: Unit tests over recipe content and the gates themselves -- no ISO, no engine.

# GIT'S REPOSITORY VARIABLES DO NOT BELONG IN A TEST'S ENVIRONMENT.
#
# githooks(5) says it outright: git exports GIT_DIR, GIT_INDEX_FILE and the rest so a hook
# can find the repository, and a hook that runs git "in a foreign repository or in a
# different working tree" must clear them first. Four tests here do exactly that --
# test_ci_lib, test_release, test_sources and test_tier_c_guard build throwaway
# repositories and run init/add/commit inside them -- and this loop handed them the hook's
# environment whole. Issue #23.
#
# Measured on git 2.43.0, three commit modes, in a throwaway repository whose pre-commit
# hook was this gate:
#
#   git commit          GIT_INDEX_FILE=.git/index -- RELATIVE, so it resolved inside
#                       whichever fixture directory the test was working in and nothing
#                       happened. Safe by accident, not by design.
#   git commit -a       GIT_INDEX_FILE is the absolute path of the commit's own lock file
#   git commit -- path  (.git/index.lock, or .git/next-index-<pid>.lock for a pathspec).
#                       A fixture's `git add -A` rewrote the index that was about to be
#                       committed: "error: invalid object ... for 'fixture-file'", "error:
#                       Error building trees", commit refused -- and this gate printed ok.
#   commit in a linked  GIT_DIR names the worktree's gitdir, absolute. Worst of the three:
#   worktree            the commit SUCCEEDED, reporting ok, and the tree it recorded was
#                       the fixture's -- one throwaway file, every real path deleted.
#
# CLEARED HERE, NOT IN run-checks.sh: every other gate must KEEP these. During a partial
# commit GIT_INDEX_FILE names the temporary index that is actually being committed, which
# is exactly what check_files() has to read -- scrubbing globally would trade a latent bug
# for a live one.
#
# CLEARED HERE, NOT IN EACH TEST: this covers the tests not written yet, and one rule in
# one place cannot drift from itself. The gap that leaves, stated rather than discovered
# later: a test run BY HAND straight from a hook is still unscrubbed.
#
# The names come from git rather than a list copied into this file, which would be one more
# pair of things to keep in step.
