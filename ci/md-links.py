"""Resolve every internal markdown link, including the half after the `#`.

WHAT WAS WRONG. `ci/checks/60-links.sh` checked the left half of a link and never the
right one. Its extractor was `grep -oE '\\]\\([^)#[:space:]]+'`, and the `#` in that
negated class stopped every target at its fragment: `[x](foo.md#bar)` had `foo.md`
checked and `#bar` discarded, while `[x](#bar)` -- a same-file anchor -- matched nothing
at all and was invisible to the gate entirely.

So a heading rename broke every link to it in silence, and five had been broken for a
day when this was written. All five named `docs/90-reference/cli.md`'s `sources` heading,
which `9907ed3` -- a self-review pass -- grew a `[--strict]` on; the slug moved and
NOTICE.md, publishing-images.md, reproducibility.md, ci.md and verbs.md kept pointing at
where it used to be. The commit that broke them touched cli.md and none of those five,
which is why this is whole-tree by design, like 45-doc-yaml and 95-status-vocab: a
staged-file gate would have passed that commit without a word.

PARSED, NOT GREPPED, and the numbers say why rather than the principle. EVERY COUNT IN THIS
DOCSTRING IS THIS TREE ON 2026-09-20 -- they are the evidence for a design decision, not a
description of the tree as you find it, and an undated one would be read as the second. 51
lines inside fenced code blocks then satisfied the ATX heading rule -- four of them
(`### TESTKIT BEGIN` and `END`, twice each) in *untagged* fences -- so a fence-blind
collector would have invented 51 anchors that do not exist, and a `#testkit-begin-1`
duplicate on top. ee69f5d had just made the same argument about a grepped check that prose
could switch off.

THREE THINGS ABOUT THE SLUG, each of which is the common case here and not an edge:

1. A CODE SPAN CONTRIBUTES ITS LITERAL CONTENTS, and must be resolved BEFORE html tags are
   stripped. `## `sources <iso> [--json F] ...`` is one code span; `<iso>` inside it is
   text, not a tag. Strip tags first and `iso` vanishes, the slug comes out wrong, and
   this reports five FALSE breaks while missing the real ones. 240 of 1041 headings here
   carry a code span. The first draft of this file got the order backwards.

2. THE CHARACTER CLASS IS UNICODE CATEGORIES, not `\\w`. GitHub keeps Letter, Number, Mark
   and Connector_Punctuation; Python's `\\w` excludes Mark, so it drops the U+FE0F after
   an emoji where GitHub keeps it, and 9 headings here slug differently between the two.
   Nothing links to those 9 today, so this changes no current verdict -- which is exactly
   why it is worth writing down now rather than discovering later.

3. HYPHENS ARE NEITHER COLLAPSED NOR TRIMMED. 189 slugs here contain `--`, 15 end in `-`
   and 6 begin with one, and two live links depend on the trailing form
   (`#rootcopyfiles-`, from a heading ending in `○`).

The tree itself is the corpus that proves all of this. On 2026-09-20 it held 55 internal
anchors, 50 of them correct-but-awkward and five broken, and a right implementation reported
exactly those five and nothing else. The five were fixed in the commit that added this file,
so the same run reports none now -- which is why that is dated rather than left to read as a
claim about today. It was true for exactly one commit.

Prints one `path:line<TAB>message` per failure on stdout; ci/checks/60-links.sh turns each
into a fail(). Exit 0 clean, 1 with failures, 2 if this script could not run -- the wrapper
treats 2 as a gate failure, because a checker that dies must not look like one that passed.
