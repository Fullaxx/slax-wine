# Contract for a check script:
#   - declares its stages in a "# stages:" header line (pre-commit, pre-push, ci)
#   - reads $KITCHEN_SCOPE: "staged" (only files staged for commit) or "tree" (whole repo)
#   - uses check_files() to get the file list for the current scope
#   - calls fail() for each problem, then exits with check_result()

# git has to actually answer, and this is checked before anything else runs.
#
# Every file-scoped gate funnels through check_files(), and check_files() funnels through
# git. When git refuses to speak -- dubious ownership, a corrupt index, not a repository --
# the file list is not an error, it is the EMPTY SET, and `|| true` in check_files_nl turns
# the refusal into silence. The gate then loops over nothing, never calls fail(), and exits
# 0. It reports success having examined no files at all.
#
# Measured 2026-09-16, not assumed: `docs/README.md` was given trailing whitespace on
# purpose. As the repo's owner, 70-whitespace printed `FAIL trailing whitespace:
# docs/README.md`. As a uid git would not answer for, the same gate on the same dirty tree
# printed NOTHING and exited 0. Five gates were in that state simultaneously --
# 00-no-binaries, 10-no-dnc, 50-secrets (since removed, #48), 60-links, 70-whitespace.
#
# `.github/workflows/ci.yml`'s container job already had to add `safe.directory` to get
# past this, and the comment there said the gates "die with git's dubious-ownership
# message instead of its own". That was wrong in the way that matters: they did not die.
# The workaround was load-bearing and nobody knew what it was bearing.
#
# This project's rule is that a check which cannot fail is worse than no check. So when git
# will not answer, refuse to run rather than pass. Every gate is invoked as `sh "$chk"`, so
# exiting here exits that gate non-zero and run-checks.sh reports it.
