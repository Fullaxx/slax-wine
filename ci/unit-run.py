"""Run one unit test file, and report any test in it that did not run.

    python3 ci/unit-run.py tests/unit/test_apply.py

WHY. Most files here keep a hand-maintained list of their test functions in `main()`.
That list can lose an entry while the function stays in the file, and nothing disagrees:
the suite still prints "all checks passed", because the check that would have failed was
never called. The failure is silent at exactly the moment somebody believes they have
added coverage.

WHY NOT READ THE FILE. ci/checks/80-unit.sh asked this question statically, twice, and
had a hole both times. Grepping for the name counted a mention in a comment or a
docstring (2026-09-20). Parsing for an `ast.Name` counted any reference in code -- so a
name left behind in a list nothing iterates, which is what a half-finished edit to that
list looks like, still read as registered:

    _LEFTOVER = [test_the_two_tables_agree]     # never called, and never reported

Each fix made the inference sharper without making it true. What is actually being asked
is "did this function run", which is not a question about the source text at all. So it
is measured: sys.setprofile fires on every call, the run's own entries are recorded, and
what is left over is named. The same move as asking Python for its temporary directory
rather than assuming /tmp (ci/tier-c.sh, 9595de4).

A file that discovers its tests from globals() needs no exemption here. It never could
have this bug, and now it does not need to be recognised either -- it simply runs them
all, and the measurement sees that.

DELIBERATE SKIPS say so, with exit 77 (the autotools convention, and not a status any
test here returns by accident). tests/unit/test_build_busybox.py skips its two tests when
there is no tar. Before this, the gate could not tell that from a pass, because a skipped
file exited 0 like everything else.

        DISABLED = {"test_the_thing": "#33 - no evidence this ever bit; justify to re-enable"}

    WHY THIS EXISTS AT ALL. A test that fails and has no incident behind it is supposed to
    be disabled and argued back through an issue, rather than adjusted until it passes --
    CONTRIBUTING.md, "What a test here is for", question 4. But the check above fails any
    test that is defined and never runs, so obeying that rule would turn the gate red, and
    the only way to switch a test off would be to delete it. Deleting it loses the one
    thing the rule is for: the trail back to why.

    THE ISSUE NUMBER IS THE POINT, not the entry. A disable nobody has to justify is just a
    quieter way of deleting the test, so an entry with no `#N` in it fails the gate exactly
    as an undeclared one does. `grep -rn DISABLED tests/` is then the list of tests waiting
    on somebody, which is a list that should be short and visible.
