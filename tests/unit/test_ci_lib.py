"""ci/lib.sh's file_size, and the size rule in 00-no-binaries that depends on it.

WHY THIS EXISTS. file_size feeds the size limit in 00-no-binaries, which calls itself the
most important gate in this repo, and nothing tested it: `grep -rl file_size tests/`
returned nothing. Two bugs lived there in succession, each the consequence of fixing the
one before.

  #19  `|| echo 0` on both branches. A stat without -c measured every file as zero, so the
       size rule passed anything while reporting ok. Fixed by answering MISSING and
       refusing it.
  #22  MISSING was then the wrong answer for a SUBMODULE. `git rev-parse` succeeds on a
       gitlink -- it returns the submodule's own commit -- and `git cat-file` fails,
       because that object is in the submodule's store. So every commit staging a
       submodule pointer failed its own pre-commit hook. This repository has
       vendor/linux-live; the next pin bump would have hit it.

Driven against throwaway repositories rather than this checkout, the way
tests/unit/test_tier_c_guard.py and test_build_busybox.py drive shell: the cases need a
staged submodule bump and an oversized file, and neither belongs in this tree.
