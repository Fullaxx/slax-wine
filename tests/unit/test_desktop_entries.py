# Adapted from slax-kitchen @ 8adfca617cecae8681b719fa7b3684b172726131 (tests/unit/test_desktop_entries.py).
# MIT, same author. ONE local change, marked LOCAL below: the fenced-block reader is
# imported from the VENDORED copy rather than a copy of our own, because this repo has
# no ci/doc-yaml.py. See docs/UPSTREAM.md. Re-adapt on a submodule bump.
"""A .desktop this repo writes must survive Slax's launcher generator.

WHY THIS EXISTS. `xlunch_genquick`, in 03-desktop.sb, ends every entry with:

    if [ -e "$Icon" ]; then
       echo "$Name;$Icon;$Exec"
    fi

If its icon search found nothing, `$Icon` is still the bare string from the file, `[ -e wine ]`
is false against the generator's cwd, and the entry is NEVER EMITTED. No error, no log line,
no tile -- the application is simply absent from the launcher. Downstream it cost both
launchers of an image whose entire point was those two launchers, and a green gate suite
never noticed. Issue #17; recorded as issue 15 in docs/30-inventory/known-upstream-bugs.md.

The search that has to fail is narrow: three shapes x three themes x four NUMERIC sizes, with
only ".png" ever appended. So `scalable/` is never searched, `.svg` is never tried, and
`Adwaita/` is not one of the three themes. `Icon=wine` -- the name Debian's own wine package
ships -- resolves to nothing, and so does `accessories-text-editor`, a standard freedesktop
name. Both measured against a built Debian 32-bit stack.

WHAT THIS CAN AND CANNOT SEE. A bare name is decidable here: either the recipe ships a .png
where the generator looks, or the tile vanishes. An ABSOLUTE path into a tree some other verb
fetches -- tor-browser's icon lives inside a 138 MB tarball -- cannot be verified statically,
and this says so rather than pretending. That half is the boot nobody has done yet.

Scope is every place this repo writes a .desktop, including the ```yaml blocks in docs/,
because the stub people copy lives in a doc rather than in a recipe.

# LOCAL CHANGE. Upstream loads this from its own ci/doc-yaml.py, which backs its
# 45-doc-yaml.sh gate. We have neither: that gate validates doc blocks against a schema/
# directory, and this repo has no schema/ of its own (ci/checks/40-schema.sh borrows the
# submodule's validator for the same reason), so copying the gate would give us one that
# can only ever print "skipping" -- the check-that-cannot-fail trap this suite exists to
# avoid. Copying the 228-line extractor WITHOUT its gate would leave a file nothing runs.
#
# So read it straight out of the submodule. Upstream's rationale was "ONE extractor, not
# two", and importing theirs satisfies that more exactly than copying it would: gate 20
# holds vendor/ byte-pristine, so drift is impossible by construction rather than by
# discipline. Module-level execution is stdlib-only (json/os/re/subprocess/sys and four
