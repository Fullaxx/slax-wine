"""ci/checks/80-unit.sh must not hand git's repository variables to the tests it runs.

WHY THIS EXISTS. githooks(5) says a hook that runs git "in a foreign repository or in a
different working tree" must clear GIT_DIR, GIT_INDEX_FILE and the rest first. Four tests
here build throwaway repositories and run init/add/commit inside them -- test_ci_lib,
test_release, test_sources, test_tier_c_guard -- and the gate ran them with the pre-commit
hook's environment inherited whole. Issue #23.

Measured on git 2.43.0 in a throwaway repository whose pre-commit hook was this gate. What
git exports depends on how the commit was invoked, so the damage does too:

  git commit           GIT_INDEX_FILE=.git/index, RELATIVE. It resolved inside the fixture
                       and nothing happened -- safe by accident.
  git commit -a        an absolute .git/index.lock; a fixture's `git add -A` rewrote the
  git commit -- path   index being committed. "error: invalid object ... for
                       'fixture-file'", "error: Error building trees", commit refused,
                       GATE PRINTED OK.
  linked worktree      an absolute GIT_DIR. The commit SUCCEEDED, gate green, and the tree
                       it recorded was `fixture-file` alone -- every real path deleted.

THE FIX IS INVISIBLE TO AN ORDINARY RUN, which is the whole reason this file exists.
Outside a hook none of those variables is set, so `unset` is a no-op and `run-checks.sh ci`
says nothing about whether the scrub works. A fix that only its own absence can detect is
what this project refuses to ship: a check which cannot fail is worse than no check.

So the gate is driven against a throwaway repository with a VALID poison pointing at a
second one -- the same shape as test_ci_lib.py and test_tier_c_guard.py, which drive shell
against fixtures rather than this checkout. Valid matters: a bogus GIT_DIR trips ci/lib.sh's
own FATAL before the loop is reached, and this would then pass for the wrong reason.
